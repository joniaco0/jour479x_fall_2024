Loading in the data, I wanted to see the trend of the total scores of baseball championships. Here is this is in line chart format. 
```{r}
Championships <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maryland-high-school-sports/record-books/refs/heads/main/spring/baseball/championships.csv")
data <- Championships |> filter(Status == "Champion") |> group_by(Year) |> summarise(TotalScore = sum(Team.Score + Opponent.Score))
data
```
```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = Year, y = TotalScore)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Total Score by Year and Class (Champions)",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Total Score"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
Now, here are the most champions in Baseball with the data collected. 
```{r}
Championships |> filter(Status == "Champion") |> group_by(Team) |> summarize(Count = n()) |> arrange (desc(Count))

```
